Origin: Starseed Medical Inc. (Medical cannabis)

File type: Raw (represents approximately 100% of testing data for Dec 1st to 10th, 2019)

File variables:
1. Independent variables – actual measurement parameters for cannabis plant
2. Dependent variable – Classification of CBD cannabis strains (none, low, average, good, best)

Notes:
According to their website, Starseed has a ”deep focus on bringing premium medicinal products to
market, we have developed the Starseed System designed to make medical cannabis easy by
classifying Starseed strains according to the cannabinoid potency. Starting with Green Star 1 our high
potency CBD cannabis strains, through to Blue Star 3, our high potency THC medical cannabis oil.”

Goal:
Although Starseed offer various grades of cannabinoid potency, the plant classification quality is
required to be “best” in order to be properly processed for medical use.
